BEACONTRACE TRANSACTION
Legal Diligence Memorandum
Prepared by: Claire Douglas, M&A Counsel
Status: Interim update

Transaction Context
Buyer is evaluating equity acquisition of BeaconTrace.
Close timing now uncertain pending remediation of newly identified issues.

Legal Findings
Intellectual property assignment gaps identified across three core modules linked to historical contractor work.
One contractor entity has incomplete assignment documentation and uncertain contact status.
Twelve enterprise customer contracts contain anti-assignment language requiring prior written consent.
Two contracts include termination rights if consent window is missed.
Four long-tenure contractors may be misclassified under local labor tests.

Assessment
Risk assessment moves from low-to-moderate to elevated.
Clean-close assumption is no longer supported.

Recommended Deal Posture
Proceed only with conditional close framework.
Prepare escrow alternatives and indemnity scope for steering review.
Create consent workstream as critical path item.

Caveat
Strategic rationale may still hold, but legal execution risk now materially influences timeline and economics.
