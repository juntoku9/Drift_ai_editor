BEACONTRACE TRANSACTION
Legal Diligence Memorandum
Prepared by: Claire Douglas
External review by: Iris Patel, External Counsel
Status: Detailed diligence update

Transaction Context
Equity acquisition remains under consideration with condition-based close path.

Carry-Forward Legal Findings
IP assignment gaps remain unresolved.
Anti-assignment customer consent risk remains unresolved.
Contractor classification exposure remains unresolved.

Additional Findings
One open-source dependency path may create source-distribution obligations unless remediated pre-close.
Data-processing addendum coverage is inconsistent for part of the EU customer set.
Incident-notification obligations in several enterprise contracts exceed current operational controls.

Recommended Controls
Increase escrow holdback and segment into targeted indemnity buckets.
Require executed assignment package for known historical contributors.
Require signed and dated consent plan for high-risk anti-assignment customers.
Require binding remediation schedule for classification and privacy-control gaps.

Post-Close Governance Recommendation
Ninety-day legal remediation sprint with weekly steering updates.
Board-level checkpoints at day 30 and day 90.

Assessment
Transaction can still proceed, but legal controls now determine viability and residual liability profile.
