NORTHLINE VENTURES
Series A Investment Memorandum
Target: ArgoFlow AI
Prepared by: Ethan Park

Revised by: Jonah Lee, Portfolio Partner
Status: Internal working draft

Executive Summary
The opportunity remains attractive, but the current case is now best framed as a structured risk-underwritten investment rather than a standard high-conviction lead. Legal risk from prior revision remains unresolved and market/commercial concentration risk is higher than originally modeled.

Proposed Transaction Terms
Prior model line at 24 million pre-money is no longer recommended.
Proposed updated structure is 18 million pre-money with 5.2 million total commitment split into two tranches.
Second tranche should be gated by legal remediation completion and concentration-risk milestones.

Company and Product Context
Core product thesis remains intact. Customers continue to describe operational dependence on workflow routing and evidence traceability.

Operating Metrics
ARR remains 1.9 million per latest update.
Net revenue retention remains reported at 136 percent.
No accounting restatement noted at this stage.

Commercial and Market Analysis Added
Top four accounts represent 61 percent of recurring revenue.
Largest account renewal is within six months and procurement team is actively evaluating alternatives.
Competitive pressure has increased in the last quarter with two adjacent vendors moving up-market.

Portfolio Considerations
There is partial overlap at workflow layer with one existing portfolio company. This is manageable but requires explicit governance protocol before board-level involvement.

Risk Section
Primary risks are now legal execution, customer concentration, and competitive window compression.
Supplier concentration and sales-cycle length remain material but secondary to the three primary items.

Diligence Status
Legal issues are defined but not remediated.
Security diligence remains open.
Concentration mitigation planning is pending management response.

Recommendation
Proceed only under staged-capital structure with explicit close conditions, milestone governance, and downside controls that are stronger than standard template.
