NORTHLINE VENTURES
Series A Investment Memorandum
Target: ArgoFlow AI
Prepared by: Ethan Park
Reviewed and revised by: Mara Singh, Due Diligence Counsel
Status: Internal working draft

Executive Summary
ArgoFlow remains an investable opportunity. However, current legal findings do not support an unconditional lead recommendation at the terms currently shown. The memo should be read as a conditional investment case pending defined remediation requirements.

Proposed Transaction Terms
Current valuation line in draft remains 24 million pre-money, but counsel view is that legal uncertainty is not priced adequately at this level.
Check size assumption remains 7 million in the working model pending deal team discussion.

Company and Product Context
ArgoFlow is positioned as workflow infrastructure for regulated operations teams. Customer utility claims remain plausible and reference quality is good.

Operating Metrics
Reported ARR at year-end is 1.9 million.
Reported gross margin is 74 percent.
Reported net revenue retention is 136 percent for early cohort.
No changes to metric table pending finance verification.

Legal Findings Added to Core Memo
Code provenance review found an incomplete assignment chain tied to a historical contractor contribution on ranking logic.
Two AGPL dependencies appear linked in production execution path rather than isolated tooling paths.
Contract language in two enterprise deals appears to overstate controls currently implemented in product.

Legal Recommendation
Do not proceed on standard structure without pre-defined legal conditions.
Required conditions should include third-party IP opinion letter, verified AGPL remediation plan, and a contract exception schedule signed by management.

Risk Section
Legal execution risk is now a primary risk, not a secondary risk.
Supplier concentration and enterprise sales-cycle risk remain in place.

Diligence Status
Legal diligence is now materially advanced and has identified actionable issues.
Security diligence is still open.
Commercial and concentration review is still in progress.

Open Items for Next IC Prep
Deal team to propose revised valuation or structure that prices legal execution risk.
Management to provide dated remediation timeline with accountable owners.
Counsel to prepare minimum close conditions language for IC review.
