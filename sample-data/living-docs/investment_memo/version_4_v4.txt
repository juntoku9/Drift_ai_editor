Status: Approved with conditions

Executive Summary
Investment Committee approved proceeding on revised economics and conditional structure. Prior unrestricted lead recommendation is superseded by this final decision record.

Approved Transaction Terms
Approved valuation is 18 million pre-money.
Approved total commitment is 5.2 million split across two tranches.
Board observer rights included.

Conditions Required Before Tranche Two
External IP opinion letter confirming no unresolved ownership claim on core ranking component.
AGPL remediation completed and verified by outside technical counsel.
Concentration mitigation plan with named owners for top renewals and explicit escalation checkpoints.

Ongoing Governance Covenants
Quarterly concentration reporting on top-ten accounts.
Semi-annual security control attestation.
Immediate committee notice if top-two churn risk exceeds defined threshold.

Risk Position at Approval
Primary risk stack at approval remains legal execution, concentration exposure, and competitive pressure.
Committee view is that approved structure prices this risk and preserves upside if execution improves.

Dissent
One IC member opposed approval, citing combined legal and concentration risk as outside first-check policy.

Action Items
Deal lead to confirm founder acceptance on tranche mechanics.
Counsel to circulate final condition checklist.
Finance to update ownership model with approved economics.
