YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Ariana Kim

What are you building
RelayOps helps logistics ops teams resolve shipment exceptions by combining system ingestion, policy checks, queue routing, and assisted communication.

Customer evidence
We re-ran account-level metrics to avoid overclaiming. Prior draft language implied broad traction too early.

Updated traction snapshot
6 pilots signed.
4 live with weekly usage.
3 showing meaningful workflow adoption beyond first week.
1 account paused due to internal IT delay.

Early outcomes where data is clean
Median first-response time down 31 percent in live accounts.
Escalation-to-manager rate down 18 percent on handled exception types.

What changed in this draft
Removed ambiguous phrase "strong enthusiasm".
Added account-quality breakdown.
Added measured outcomes with explicit scope limits.

Open weakness we now state directly
Current product handles a subset of exception types well, not full exception universe.

Application tone
Still ambitious, but now grounded in measurable and defensible claims.
