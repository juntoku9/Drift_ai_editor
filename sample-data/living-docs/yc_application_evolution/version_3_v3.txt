YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Mina Lopez

What are you building
RelayOps is workflow infrastructure for shipment exceptions. We reduce manual triage and response time for logistics ops teams.

Who feels the pain
Dispatch managers and customer operations leads at freight brokers and 3PLs.

Proof users want this
Across pilot accounts, team leads report same-day reduction in backlog once we route and draft first response. Users care less about AI novelty and more about faster closure and fewer escalations.

Traction snapshot
6 pilots in progress.
4 accounts have weekly active users.
2 accounts are still in setup and not yet stable.

Commercial direction in this draft
Shifted from broad top-of-funnel language to narrow ICP narrative.
Added clearer target buyer and workflow entry point.
Added repeatable ROI framing around backlog reduction and resolution time.

Why now
Teams are being asked to maintain service levels without adding headcount. Point tools do not solve cross-system coordination.

Application positioning
Less hype, more concrete buyer pain and measurable impact.
