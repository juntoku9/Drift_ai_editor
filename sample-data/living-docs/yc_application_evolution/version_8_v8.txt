YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Ariana Kim

What are you building
RelayOps is a policy-aware workflow system for logistics exception handling. We reduce resolution time and escalation load by routing issues, generating constrained action drafts, and keeping humans in approval control for higher-risk actions.

Who this is for
Initial segment is mid-market freight brokers and 3PL operators with high exception volume and fragmented tools.

Current traction summary
6 pilots signed.
4 live.
3 with sustained weekly usage.
2 converted to paid annual contracts at 54 thousand blended ACV.

What works today
Faster first response and lower escalation rates in the exception categories we support.
Strong buyer interest when we frame value as operational throughput and policy consistency.

What is still hard
Onboarding is too manual.
Data quality varies across carrier integrations.
Coverage is strong for selected categories but incomplete for long-tail exceptions.

Why now
Teams need headcount leverage and control consistency, not more dashboarding.
Model capability plus policy-constrained orchestration makes this feasible now in workflows that were previously too messy.

What we are asking YC to believe
We can win by starting with one painful wedge, proving measurable workflow value, and expanding category coverage while keeping trust and control intact.

Founder note
This final version intentionally favors credibility over hype and reflects what we have actually learned in pilots.
