YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Noah Feld

What are you building
RelayOps improves exception-resolution throughput for logistics operations teams with policy-aware assisted workflows.

Revenue and pricing clarity added
Prior draft avoided concrete commercial structure. This version adds current pricing model and conversion assumptions.

Current commercial snapshot
2 pilots converted to paid annual contracts.
Blended ACV for converted accounts is 54 thousand.
Pipeline includes 9 qualified accounts in similar segment.

Unit-economic signal in current stage
Onboarding effort is still high and must be reduced for scale.
Gross margin profile appears healthy if support load declines after onboarding templates mature.

What changed in this draft
Added paid conversion data and ACV.
Removed implied near-term hypergrowth language.
Added explicit scaling bottleneck around onboarding cost.

Honest risk statement
If we do not productize onboarding in the next two quarters, growth will remain services-constrained.
