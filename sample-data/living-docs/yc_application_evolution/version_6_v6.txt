YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Iris Patel

What are you building
RelayOps provides assisted workflow execution for shipment exceptions with human approval controls and audit logging.

Compliance and liability language update
Prior versions used language that could imply autonomous decisioning. This version clarifies that high-impact actions require human approval and that policy checks are mandatory pre-send controls.

Data handling posture
We process operational shipment data and communication metadata.
We do not require storage of sensitive identity documents for core workflow categories in current scope.

Risk controls now described in application
Audit trail for suggested and approved actions.
Role-based approval thresholds by customer.
Configurable policy constraints before outbound communication.

Traction and product scope retained from V5
6 pilots signed, 4 live, 3 sustained.
Focused category wedge remains damaged freight and delayed handoff.

What changed in this draft
Removed legal-risky wording around autonomous resolution.
Added explicit guardrail language and approval boundaries.
Strengthened credibility of enterprise readiness narrative.
