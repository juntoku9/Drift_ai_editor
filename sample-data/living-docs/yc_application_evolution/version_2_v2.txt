YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Devin Rao

What are you building
RelayOps is an exception-resolution workflow platform for logistics teams with AI assistance built into each decision step.

What is the problem
Ops teams process thousands of edge-case tickets where data is incomplete and resolution policy varies by customer contract. Current systems track state but do not coordinate action owners.

Current product statement
We ingest event streams and inbox messages, detect exception types, route to the right queue, and generate policy-aware action drafts. Human approvers remain in the loop for high-risk actions.

Technical architecture note
Model output is constrained by deterministic policy checks before outbound actions are allowed. We are not running fully autonomous execution.

Traction snapshot
6 pilot logos remain active, but usage quality varies by account and lane type.

What changed in this draft
Removed language implying full automation.
Clarified human-in-the-loop boundaries.
Clarified that reliability and policy correctness are more important than demo speed.

Why now
Data exhaust from logistics systems is rich but underused. Better model orchestration and policy systems now make operational automation practical without fully removing human control.
