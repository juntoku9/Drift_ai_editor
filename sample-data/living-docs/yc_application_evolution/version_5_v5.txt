YC Application Working Draft
Company name: RelayOps
Primary editor: Priya Nwosu

What are you building
RelayOps is a decision-support workflow layer for shipment exceptions, focused first on damaged freight and delayed handoff categories.

Customer discovery synthesis
We interviewed 17 operations leaders in freight brokerage and 3PL environments.
Most teams are not asking for full autonomy. They want predictable routing, policy consistency, and faster first response.

Top adoption blockers identified
Policy mismatch across customer contracts.
Data quality gaps from carrier event feeds.
Trust concerns when automated drafts sound generic or overly confident.

Product refinements based on discovery
Narrowed initial category focus to high-volume exception types with cleaner policy boundaries.
Added mandatory confidence and rationale snippets for every suggested action.
Added per-customer policy profile as core onboarding step.

Traction snapshot retained
6 pilots signed, 4 live, 3 showing sustained usage.

What changed in this draft
Shifted narrative from broad automation platform to narrow wedge with explicit expansion path.
Added blockers section to show honest understanding of implementation risk.
