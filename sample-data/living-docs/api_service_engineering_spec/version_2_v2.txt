EVENT INGESTION SERVICE V2
Engineering Specification
Owner: Noah Kim
Updated by: Sara Holm, SRE Manager
Status: Draft

Problem Statement
Current ingestion API is approaching throughput and operability limits while failure behavior under stress remains too fragile for broad rollout.

Primary Objective
Maintain five-times throughput ambition while making service behavior predictable under dependency volatility.

Architecture in This Draft
Multi-AZ durability is now required for launch readiness.
Synchronous path must include server-side backpressure controls.
Idempotency keys are required for safe retry handling.
Dead-letter path is required for malformed and repeated-failure events.

Operational Findings
Incident replay showed queue growth and retry storms during dependency jitter.
Client-only retries create cascading amplification.
Current observability plan does not support tenant-level triage quickly enough.

Performance Targets
Throughput target remains 25k events per second.
Latency target remains p95 under 150 milliseconds with added monitoring of tail behavior.

Readiness Gates Added
Failure-mode drills complete.
Runbooks tested with on-call ownership.
Traffic-shedding controls validated before broad tenant onboarding.

Scope
Core scope retained with reliability controls as mandatory additions.

Out of Scope
Multi-region remains staged, but failover plan documentation is now required before GA.
