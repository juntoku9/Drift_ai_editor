EVENT INGESTION SERVICE V2
Engineering Specification
Owner: Noah Kim, Staff Engineer
Status: Draft

Problem Statement
Current ingestion API is approaching throughput and operability limits as tenant event volume grows.

Primary Objective
Achieve five-times sustained throughput increase while improving acknowledgment latency and preserving durability guarantees.

Architecture in This Draft
Single-region deployment.
Stateless API tier behind managed load balancer.
Synchronous write path to primary datastore.
Client SDK retries for transient failures.

Performance Targets
Throughput target 25k events per second.
Acknowledgment p95 target under 150 milliseconds.

Scope
New ingest endpoint.
API key authentication.
Schema validation pipeline.
Baseline rate limiting.
Usage metering hooks.

Out of Scope
Multi-region failover.
Replay tooling.
Tenant-specific traffic isolation.

Known Risks
Retry amplification during dependency instability.
Datastore pressure during spikes.
Limited tenant-level observability during incidents.
