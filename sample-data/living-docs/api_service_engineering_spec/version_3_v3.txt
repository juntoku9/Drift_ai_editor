EVENT INGESTION SERVICE V2
Engineering Specification
Owners: Platform Engineering and SRE
Updated by: Priya Narang, Security Engineering
Status: Draft

Problem Statement
Service must meet throughput goals and contractual security/compliance expectations at the same time.

Primary Objective
Ship a durable ingestion platform with clear operational controls for high-assurance enterprise tenants.

Architecture in This Draft
Reliability controls from prior revision are retained.
Authentication upgraded from API key-only approach to scoped token model with key-age enforcement.
Optional signed-request mode added for high-assurance tenants.
Immutable audit trail required for auth failures and policy violations.
Sensitive-data detection required before persistence.
Tenant-configurable retention controls required to align with contract obligations.

Blocking Items
Threat model not complete.
Key-rotation runbook not complete.
Data-classification tagging in pipeline not complete.

Performance Targets
Throughput and latency targets retained.
Release decision now depends on control readiness, not performance only.

Readiness Gates
No promotion beyond beta cohort until security checklist and runbooks are complete and tested.

Scope
Core ingest scope retained with security controls integrated into baseline delivery.
