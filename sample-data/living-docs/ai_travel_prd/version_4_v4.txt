ATLAS TRAVEL COPILOT
Product Requirements Document
Owners: Product, Engineering, Legal
Updated by: Niko Brandt, GTM Lead
Status: Working draft

Product Goal
Atlas provides travel planning assistance and aims to become a repeat discovery and planning surface over time.

Launch Plan in Current Draft
Q2 gated beta remains unchanged.
No fixed public launch date remains unchanged.

Scope in Current Draft
Phase-one scope remains planning-first:
One-prompt itinerary generation.
Hotel and activity recommendations.
Editable day-by-day planner.
Shareable itinerary links.
Terms acknowledgment and profile deletion.
Confidence and limitation disclosures.

GTM Proposal Added to Strategy Section
Destination inspiration feed proposed for growth.
Social itinerary card format proposed for distribution.
Referral loop proposed for post-plan conversion.

Cross-Functional Review Notes Captured in Draft
Engineering notes that adding new surfaces before reliability gates increases launch risk.
Legal notes referral concept may be viable, but sponsored placement requires disclosure design and review.
Product notes that phase-one trust and reliability commitments should not be diluted.

Current Resolution in Draft
Discovery and referral ideas remain in strategy section only.
They are listed as phase-two candidates, not phase-one commitments.

Risks
Risk of narrative drift toward breadth before trust baseline is established.
Risk of execution overload if growth surfaces are pulled into phase one.

Open Questions
Can launch-quarter demand goals be reached through messaging and partnerships without adding product surfaces in phase one.
