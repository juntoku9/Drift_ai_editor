ATLAS TRAVEL COPILOT
Product Requirements Document
Owner: Maya Ortiz
Updated by: Ravi Menon, Engineering Lead
Status: Working draft

Product Goal
Atlas converts freeform trip intent into complete day plans with alternatives users can review and edit.

Launch Plan in Current Draft
Public beta date is now treated as target, not fixed commitment.
Rollout moves to gated beta in Q2 based on reliability thresholds.
Initial rollout markets are narrowed to United States and Japan.

Scope in Current Draft
One-prompt itinerary generation.
Hotel and activity recommendations.
Editable day-by-day planner.
Shareable itinerary links.
Flight and hotel booking links removed from phase-one scope and deferred.

Performance and Reliability Expectations
p95 target updated to under 15 seconds for beta readiness.
Reliability target added: blank-itinerary failure below 2 percent for two consecutive weeks.
Incident runbook and on-call ownership required before invite expansion.

Engineering Findings Informing Edits
Production-like tests showed p95 between 19 and 28 seconds.
Supplier timeout clusters created partial itinerary render in approximately 11 to 16 percent of requests.
Retry behavior currently amplifies queue congestion during upstream instability.

Success Metrics
Completion and retention targets retained.
Booking-link click-through moved to phase-two metric set.

Risks
Primary near-term risk is reliability-led trust failure at launch.
Supplier dependency risk remains material.

Open Questions
Whether confidence labeling can offset deferred booking actions in phase one.
Whether latency goals are realistic without architectural fallback improvements.
