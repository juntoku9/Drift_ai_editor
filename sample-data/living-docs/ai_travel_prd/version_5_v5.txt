ATLAS TRAVEL COPILOT
Product Requirements Document
Owners: Executive Staff with Product, Engineering, Legal, GTM
Status: Approved direction

Product Goal
Atlas launches as a trust-first planning product and expands into broader discovery only after quality gates are met.

Launch Plan
Phased beta in Q2 is approved.
No fixed public launch date until all gates are complete.

Final Phase-One Scope
One-prompt itinerary generation.
Hotel and activity recommendations.
Editable day-by-day planner.
Shareable itinerary links.
Terms acknowledgment and profile deletion workflow.
Confidence cues and limitation disclosures.

Deferred to Phase Two
Direct booking links.
Destination inspiration feed.
Referral loop.
Paid placements.

Launch Gates
Legal and privacy sign-off complete.
Policy violation rate below 1 percent.
Reliability thresholds sustained for two consecutive weeks.
Incident ownership and escalation process tested.

Ownership Model
Product and Legal co-own launch readiness checklist.
Engineering owns reliability operations and incident process.
GTM owns external messaging within approved constraints.

Risk Posture
Primary launch risk remains trust failure from reliability or compliance miss.
Expansion risk is managed by explicit phase sequencing.

Decision Note
This version keeps prior cross-functional constraints and resolves conflict through ordered rollout rather than scope inflation.
