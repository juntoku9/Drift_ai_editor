        "content": "YC Application Working Draft\nCompany name: RelayOps\nPrimary editor: Ariana Kim\n\nWhat are you building\nRelayOps is an AI operations copilot for logistics teams. We automate exception handling in shipment operations where humans currently copy data between carrier portals, email threads, and spreadsheets.\n\nWhat is the problem\nMid-market shippers lose hours every day resolving damaged freight claims, delayed handoffs, and address correction loops. Existing TMS platforms store status but do not execute the exception workflow end to end.\n\nCurrent product statement\nWe ingest events from carriers and warehouse systems, classify issues, suggest next actions, and draft outbound communication. Ops leads can approve or edit before execution.\n\nTraction snapshot\nWe have 6 pilot customers and strong enthusiasm from users.\n\nWhy now\nLarge language models can finally parse messy shipment communication and unstructured documents at useful accuracy. Logistics teams are under margin pressure and need headcount leverage.\n\nLong-term vision\nBecome the workflow layer for every post-booking shipment exception.\n\nApplication tone\nBold and high-conviction. This draft is intentionally aggressive."

Current systems track state but do not coordinate action owners.\n\nCurrent product statement\nWe ingest event streams and inbox messages, detect exception types, route to the right queue, and generate policy-aware action drafts. Human approvers remain in the loop for high-risk actions.\n\nTechnical architecture note\nModel output is constrained by deterministic policy checks before outbound actions are allowed. We are not running fully autonomous execution.\n\nTraction snapshot\n6 pilot logos remain active, but usage quality varies by account and lane type.\n\nWhat changed in this draft\nRemoved language implying full automation.\nClarified human-in-the-loop boundaries.\nClarified that reliability and policy correctness are more important than demo speed.\n\nWhy now\nData exhaust from logistics systems is rich but underused. Better model orchestration and policy systems now make operational automation practical without fully removing human control."

Users care less about AI novelty and more about faster closure and fewer escalations.\n\nTraction snapshot\n6 pilots in progress.\n4 accounts have weekly active users.\n2 accounts are still in setup and not yet stable.\n\nCommercial direction in this draft\nShifted from broad top-of-funnel language to narrow ICP narrative.\nAdded clearer target buyer and workflow entry point.\nAdded repeatable ROI framing around backlog reduction and resolution time.\n\nWhy now\nTeams are being asked to maintain service levels without adding headcount. Point tools do not solve cross-system coordination.\n\nApplication positioning\nLess hype, more concrete buyer pain and measurable impact."
